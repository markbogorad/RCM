**Purpose:**  
 To retrieve information on key accounts and contacts and memorialize them in Salesforce following our templated entry setup

 **Skills:** 

 1. **Scan SharePoint to source relevant data:** 
    - Find the right information on folks by looking in the open internet. An extra emphasis on correct information here - if doubtful or hard to find just list either several options found for one field (if doubtful) or not found if not found
  
 2. **Follow Our Templated Recording Setup:** 
    - The main categories for recording things are:

- Prioritize accuracy in information
- Always quote sources when doing an external internet search so one can manually check
